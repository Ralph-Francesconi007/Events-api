## Events Application

This application allows users to be able to post their events to the application and let their friends and fellow colleagues see their events that they post. The events that are posted can be anything that the user wants them to be and users can RSVP to the event so the host can know the amount of people that are definetly coming. I have set up an Events log that everytime a user logs in, they are directed to this page so they can see the new events that other users post. With these other posts they can RSVP to the event to let them know that they are coming or they can post an event of their own by hitting the "Create Event" link at the nav bar. Then when the user is done exploring the different events that they want to go too, they can sign-out.

## Planning Story

When I was planning on how to do this project the first thing that I thought of doing was to make an ERD diagram so I knew what I wanted to do for the relationships between entities. The ERD mapped the relationships out for me so I knew where to begin. I began setting up the Schema and by doing this I could figure out what I wanted to send to the database to be stored. Then I created the routes and being able to create the routes and being able to do the CRUD actions, I just needed to test them with the curl-scripts that I created. Once I tested the routes with curl-scripts and everything came back the way I wanted it to, then I could begin working on the application itself.
